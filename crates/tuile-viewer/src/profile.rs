//! How hard a session may push the machine it runs on.
//!
//! The viewer is one program on a desktop and on a phone, and nearly every
//! difference between the two is a number: how much ground the GPU holds,
//! how many reads the store serves at once, how many threads decode, how big
//! the tile store is, how many frames a second are worth drawing when nothing
//! moves. Those numbers live here, side by side, so the two machines are
//! compared in one place instead of in `cfg` blocks scattered through the
//! session.
//!
//! What a session may hold, load and upload is the graphics budget's
//! ([`Profile::budget`]): its numbers are sized here from the device.
//! [`Profile::handheld`] is sized from the phone: it shares one pool of
//! memory between the CPU and the GPU, and the system ends an application
//! that takes too much of it without asking — so the budget is a share of
//! what the process may still take, not a constant.
//!
//! [`Profile::browser`] is a page: the desktop's numbers or the phone's, cut
//! to what a tab may hold — the worker that keeps the residency is a wasm32
//! heap, four gibibytes at the very most — drawn on demand, and paused while
//! the tab is hidden.
