# tuile-tile-server

Source tiles, kept once.

A tile server's job, minus the HTTP: terrain and imagery tiles as their
source delivered them, stored in PMTiles archives on an object store, one
set of archives per **zone** and per **layer**, served back by tile address.

- [`grid`] maps a source's own addressing onto an archive's quadtree.
- [`layer`] says how a layer is split into zones and cut into epochs.
- [`archive`] writes and reads one immutable archive.
- [`catalog`] is the list of layers, kept in the bucket itself.
- [`content`] makes the store the engine's tile cache.
- [`manifest`] is the list of archives a zone is made of, replaced by
  conditional writes.
- [`store`] puts it together: a mutable buffer in memory, deltas, a
  streaming compaction, and cleanup — safe with any number of writers.
- [`disk`] keeps whole archives on local disk, so a zone's second tile is
  local.
- [`index`] says what an archive holds without its bytes: its tile ids
  and a stamp of each, told to the host's register as it is published.
- [`absences`] is where what a source does not have is kept.
- [`ledger`] is what a register is told, and what it tells a reader back;
  [`register`] is one in memory, and the reference of what one does.
- [`lru`] is the budgeted least-recently-used map the caches share.
- [`projection`] takes a scene's slice of the store to local archives.
- [`tiering`] picks what a compaction merges: similar sizes, contiguous.
- [`service`] adds the upstream: fetched once, stored, served, the hot
  tiles and the source's absences kept in memory.

No router and no authentication here: those belong to whoever deploys it.

# Environment

Concurrency limits, each read once per process, a missing, unparsable or
zero value keeping the default:

- `TUILE_PROJECTION_ZONES` (16): zones a projection works on at once.
- `TUILE_PROJECTION_RANGES` (8): byte ranges of one zone a projection
  fetches at once.
- `TUILE_FLUSH_ZONES` (16): zones a store flushes at once.
- `TUILE_UPLOAD_PARTS` (8): parts of one archive upload in flight.
- `TUILE_DEDUP` (32): tiles of one publication checked against the store
  at once.
- `TUILE_EXTRACT_ZONES` (16): zones an extract reads at once.
- `TUILE_EXTRACT_TILES` (32): tiles of one archive an extract reads at once.
- `TUILE_EXTRACT_PUT_PARTS` (8): parts of an extract's upload in flight.

## Where it sits

Depends on `tuile-core` (the `ContentStore` the [`content`] module
implements). Used by `tuile-bake`, which fills it, and by `tuile-repository`
and `tuile-pack-api`, which read and serve it.

## Example

```rust
use tuile_tile_server::grid::Grid;

// A geographic layer is stored one level down in the archive's quadtree.
let id = Grid::Geographic.to_id(3, 10, 2)?;
assert_eq!(Grid::Geographic.from_id(id), Some((3, 10, 2)));
# Ok::<(), tuile_tile_server::grid::OutOfGrid>(())
```

## Features

None.
