//! The textures a frame is drawn into, before it reaches a surface.
//!
//! Every wgpu host writes these two by hand and writes them the same way, and
//! the one detail that is easy to get wrong is the one that fails loudly: the
//! sample count of the colour target, the depth target and the pipelines must
//! agree exactly, or the first draw call fails validation rather than merely
//! looking wrong. Four separate test harnesses in this repository were silently
//! failing that check for weeks, each having been written before MSAA reached
//! the renderer, and each reporting a wgpu validation panic instead of whatever
//! it was actually there to measure.
//!
//! Owning the pair here is what makes that impossible to get wrong: the count
//! comes from [`crate::SAMPLES`], which is the same constant the pipelines are
//! built against.
//!
//! The surface itself is **not** here. This crate creates no window and no
//! surface — the host owns those, and owns the resolve into them.
